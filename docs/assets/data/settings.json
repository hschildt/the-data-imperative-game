Algorithms themselves are now readily available as open source, but their use requires services of skilled data scientists. Moreover, sophisticated algorithms are not much use without high volumes of fairly high quality data. Algorithms are central to managerial pursuit of “digital omniscience”, the efforts to understand and model the world through software rather than human intuition. Once set up, algorithms can make decisions instantly and at no cost, opening up opportunities for entirely new kinds of business processes."
